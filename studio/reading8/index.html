  This article shared the knowledge of how to think of time and the time we have set. "Time is something we somehow register as a concept of past and future...are constantly shuttling between two times." Even though I know there have been numerous studies about time and theories, the way I've been interacting with time was flat and simple. However, since time is more of duration than a pinpointed moment,  I understand the need for a creative form of a clock that conveys such concept and idea.
