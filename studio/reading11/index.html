  Reading the article, I realized that most of the works we name and define were based on the media we work with. For example, as new technology arises, we specifically name graphic designs into UI/UX design, Motion Graphics design, and web design. However, Artists should be the ones who create ideas rather than relying on machine or technique. This is why Conditional Design came out, to avoid being defined by the media we work with and refer to our approach. At this point, do you have your pattern of starting work? If so, how would you name your work based on your personal approach rather than the media you chose?

Furthermore, Conditional Design is helpful for any process of exploring the creative process. It values the approach and progress that understands contexts of the work, rather than the name of form or content. It empowers a creation by many users, decentralizes authority, and create the design in an open system. Is there a work that pops up in your mind that represents certain Conditional Design? Have you ever contributed to it before?
