  After reading this book, I thought this designer is a crazy genius. Before reading his book, I never knew how having complex and simple criteria would allow creative diversions. Seeing how possibilities are derived from complexity, I am amazed.
  For example, having a square box of complex criteria allowed to bring multiple options through manipulating the variations.

  Since I mostly believed that rules are only for restraining, this totally changed my view. I should also follow the method in order to make a best decisions in my design.

  As from the title, this systematic approach could bring in creative output in many fields, ranging from typography, photography, and music.
