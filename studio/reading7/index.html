  Every era, every generation, has to construct and reconstruct its political beliefs, and subsequent
  visuals, out of the stuff that surrounds it at any given moment. Protest signs will be made out of the
  cardboard, paper and textile available at that given time and place at a local hardware store;... The same goes for the visual stuff of the internet; every generation will
  construct new, “political” beliefs out of it; out of all kinds of stuff, which seemed initially nonpolitical.">

The following quote helped me understand how "meme," which is the
 units of culture and behaviour, communicates with massive public by its eye-catching contents. For example, I remember that few years ago at Korea, when our previous president was impreached, tons of memes were created. I could feel how memes works on policitcal or social topics, and unites people throught its own humourous way. I believe it is such a powerful way to promote or spread certain idea. If you have to promote your website, what kind of memes would you makes?
