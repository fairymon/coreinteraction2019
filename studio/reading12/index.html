  In the reading "Fuck Content,” Michael Rock clarifies the difference between author and designer and further emphasizes the importance of storytelling through design.
  Even though content is truly important to designers as he mentioned "form without content (as if that were even possible) is some kind of empty shell,” it is important to recognize that designers should master not the content but the narratives through typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale, and weight. No doubt, as Beatrice Warde’s famous Crystal Goblet metaphor says, we graphic designers should focus on not making a color or taste or wine, but the color, shape, transparency, and size of the wine glass.
