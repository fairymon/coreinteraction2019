J.R Carpenter / A Handmade Web

I liked the quote, "I evoke the term 'Handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials,
such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books." It gives a sense that the webpage that
we see in the screen, possess hand-made feelings. Honestly, before learning coding before,
I never thought web as handy or familiar feeling object. Through using the term, it really does convey "ongoing" feelings from webs. So, my question would be, including webs, apps, and any other technology-based products, which has felt most unfamiliar and unhandy to you so far, and rethinking of those objects, how would you redesign them
in terms of your own 'handmade products.'

  Also, I highly agreed with the point that, "handheld devices distanced us from the handmade web." Do you think the design of those devices itself would effect on how we feel such webs? For example, did the transition from heavy and bulking desktops to ipads or smartphones contribute the way we percieve webs?
