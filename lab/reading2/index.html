<h2> What We Mean When We Say “responsive”
</h2>
<p>
  <i>“I believe the definition of “responsive” to be evolving, an abstract concept that eludes direct semantic policing. It’s as yet too nascent and amorphous to have a universally-accepted meaning; it’s a word whose genesis lacked unified intent,”</i>
Since I never heard about “responsive” design, before studying web coding, I can tell it’s a new and evolved term. The reason why I also believe the definition of “responsive” is evolving rather than fixed, is because, it emerged as our technology around us improved further. Since we have diverse sizes of devices, the concept “responsiveness” has emerged. However, the thing is, the technology is improving every moment, and in the future, we might not even use 2d devices, like tablets or laptops. In that case, no doubt, the definition of “responsiveness” would be totally different.
