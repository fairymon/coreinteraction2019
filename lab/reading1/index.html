  I liked the reading "How to learn Css," as it sounded more reasonable for me to work on coding projects, which I want to perform, while not knowing the whole rules of coding. I think both learning the fundamental basics of coding and seeing how other designers have accomplished throught coding is important. This is because the field of coding is keep expanding its area, and the knowledge of it are getting broader and broader. No doubt, fundamental understanding would be help to build a foundation of a work, but also keep being inspired by other's works and adapting them in your own taste, would help making creative work.

"About low-tech magazine's solar powered website" helped me realized another aspect of webdesign, which I didn't think about before. Thinking about the electricity that millions of websites in the Internet would use, I had no doubt that it would seriously take so much of energy. For that reason, I learned that it is a designer's responsitbility to keep their work sustainable for our planet.

I was impressed how the author is so thoughtful about the audiences of his/her's webpage. It made sense to keep an eye on the structures below the suface of the design, that people with disabilities could also participate in the work.
