  It is said that the advertising industry later found out that they were abusing JavaScript. In terms of using right amount of
  JavaScript in order to not abuse it, how would I know whether it is being abused or not? What standards should I be prepare within in order to prevent that?
</p>



<P>I reflected on myself so much when I read, "Web designers who ignored the message of John Allsoppâ€™s A Dao of Web Design made the mistake of treating the web like print." Honestly, the way I approaced building web pages were based on my experience in
  editorial design. However, since web is a different medium from prints, I felt that I should approach my project in different
  ways compared to how I started my editorial designs, which were based on typography, color schemes, and hierarchy. In order to
  set new standards, what kinds of fundamental rules should I set in the beginning and follow?
</p>

<p> I often heard language changes the way we think, and so the author says. However, whether the changes are timid or not, I never felt my thought processes changing when I speak Korean and English. As coding is regarded as a different language,
  would our mind really be affected by using it? If so, how would it shape our minds?
