  Every era, every generation, has to construct and reconstruct its political beliefs, and subsequent
  visuals, out of the stuff that surrounds it at any given moment. Protest signs will be made out of the
  cardboard, paper and textile available at that given time and place at a local hardware store;... The same goes for the visual stuff of the internet; every generation will
  construct new, “political” beliefs out of it; out of all kinds of stuff, which seemed initially nonpolitical.">

The following quote helped me understand how "meme," which is the
 units of culture and behaviour, which survive and spread via imitation and adaptation, represents certain era and culture. In terms of Internet era, where most of our contemporary culture are created based on internet, numerous memes that represent this era has been created. As internet has evolved more, "Interaction" is one of the most powerful meme of this era. What kind of memes do you want to show in your website?
